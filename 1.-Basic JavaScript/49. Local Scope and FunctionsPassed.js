/*
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  var loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}
myTest(); // logs "foo"
console.log(loc); // loc is not defined

loc is not defined outside of the function.
 */

 //Instruction
 //Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope. 
 //Run the tests and then follow the instructions commented out in the editor.

 function myLocalScope() {
    'use strict'; // you shouldn't need to edit this line
    var myVar = 'Info';
    console.log(myVar);
  }
  myLocalScope();
  
  // Run and check the console
  // myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
  console.log(myVar);
  
  // Now remove the console log line to pass the test
